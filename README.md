Business Card Reader Pro interface
==================================

This extension provides an interface between CiviCRM and the Business Card Reader Pro mobile application.

The iPhone application is available [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/business-card-reader-pro/id328175747). You can test with the trial version but will need the paid version to use operationaly.

This extension is used in production by Cividesk customers, but is contributed as-is and unsupported for anyone else. In particular, it does not come with documentation or a nice setup GUI - documentation, code and/or monetary contributions most welcomed.
